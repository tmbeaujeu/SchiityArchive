        <p>Lyr is a extremely high-output headphone amplifier with a new Dynamically Adaptive output stage that provides high voltage output into virtually any headphone—up to 6 watts into 32 ohms—while maintaining excellent overall efficiency.</p><br>
        <p>Now, if you’re a headphone guy, you’re thinking “Holy Schiit! 6 watts! That’ll make the magic smoke come out of my headphones! Why the hell do you need that kind of power?” Well, we have one word for you: orthodynamics. And two more: Why not? If everyone wanted polite little low-power headphone amps, this would be one awfully boring world, wouldn’t it?</p><br>
        <p>That said, Lyr isn’t just about brute force. Sure, it has dynamics to spare, but it also delivers music with grace and finesse. Its hybrid design uses ECC88 tubes for the input stage, and the topology is DC coupled at the input and output to ensure the purest, most direct signal path.</p><br>
        <p>Make no mistake: even though Lyr is the same size as Asgard and Valhalla, it’s one of the most powerful headphone amplifiers you can buy. We will not be responsible if you blow up your headphones with it!</p><br>
        <p><strong>Dynamically Adaptive Output Stage</strong><br>
        No. Don’t roll your eyes and dismiss this as marketing bullschiit. Our new Dynamically Adaptive output stage allows us to pack almost 6X the output power of Asgard into an amp that runs slightly cooler. (Now, that doesn’t mean it runs cool. If you want a cold amp, you need to look elsewhere.) It works by sensing the current flowing through the output stage, and dynamically reconfiguring from Class-A single-ended to push-pull Class AB. The result is both pure Class-A sound and the ability to drive virtually any headphone, including low-impedance and low-efficiency models (orthodynamics, we’re looking at you.)</p><br>
        <p><strong>Roll Your Own</strong><br>
        Lyr ships with JJ ECC88 tubes, but feel free to substitute any 6DJ8, 6922, or ECC88 type tube, new or old, American or Russian or Chinese. The ability to use different tubes lets you tune the overall sound signature of Lyr to your specific needs.</p>
