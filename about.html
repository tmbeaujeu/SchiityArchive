    <h2>About Schiity Archive</h2>
  <p>
    I created Schiity Archive to make it easier to find product information and user manuals 
    for the products that Schiit no longer produces. A Head-Fi user named "liquidsmote" 
    built an excellent entry-based version of this idea, which you can 
    <a href="https://alex77464.wixsite.com/schiitarchive" target="_blank">see here</a>. 
    However, their site hasnâ€™t been updated in over five years. 
    Schiit also has a "bullet point guide" to their past products
    <a href="https://www.schiit.com/guides/brief-list" target="_blank">on their website</a>, but it lacks images and detailed information like product specs.
    This site aims to pick up where "liquidsmote" left off, and provide a more comprehensive archive of Schiit's discontinued products.
  </p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting Schiity Archive!</p>
